This project implements the MobileNetV1 model using PyTorch, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture designed for mobile and embedded devices.
MobileNetV1 is known for its efficiency and high performance on image classification tasks, making it suitable for applications with limited computational resources.

The primary objective of this project is to explore MobileNetV1's capabilities and practical applications in real-world scenarios.
To achieve this, the model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which comprises 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 classes.
By training MobileNetV1 on CIFAR-10, the project aims to assess its accuracy and efficiency in classifying images across various categories.
